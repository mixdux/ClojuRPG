ClojuRPG
========

A text RPG, fully written in Clojure!

This is my first big project coded in Clojure and none of the functions used are hard to understand or reproduce. ClojuRPG is designed to be changed to fit everyone's RPG developing needs. From the first lines, it is designed so that it can be easily molded, with minimal code alterations, so that one can make it's own RPG by rewriting text and adding progress marks 
Text

There is a separate nemaspace called Localisation and all text is contained there. Should you change it so you create your own RPG, make shure that all the story is contained there (whith the appropriate naming, of course)
